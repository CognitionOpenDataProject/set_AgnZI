For this article please focus on findings reported in Section 3.2 The spontaneous-response FB-task (SR-FB). Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> For the dependent measure we coded total looking times at the two upper exits of the Y-shaped tunnel (Fig. 2). For each child, we then calculated a differential looking score (DLS) by subtracting looking to the incorrect exit from looking to the correct exit, and by dividing it by the sum of time spent on looking to correct and incorrect exits (Senju et al., 2009). The DLS-s range from +1 to  1, DLS-s closer to +1 are considered as anticipatory looking mostly towards the correct area. The mean DLS for each group are shown in Fig. 3.

> As revealed by a one-way ANOVA, there was a significant difference in DLS between the three groups, F2,27 = 7.31, p = 0.003, g2 = 0.35. Planned contrasts showed that the TH-children outperformed the CI-children, t21 = 2.58, p = 0.017, g2 = 0.24, and the HA-children t20 = 4.01, p = 0.001, g2 = 0.45.

> Additional t tests showed that the TH-children scored significantly above zero (M = 0.72, SD = 0.40), t14 = 6.87, p < 0.001, g2 = 0.77 (see Fig. 3). In contrast, the DLS did not reach significantly above zero in the CI-children (M = 0.16, SD = 0.65), t7 = 0.68, p = 0.519, g2 = 0.06, or the HA-children (M =  0.10, SD = 0.53), t6 =  0.51, p = 0.629, g2 = 0.04.

> Thirteen out of 15 children in the TH group looked first at the correct location directly after the cat disappeared in the tunnel in search of the mouse (p = 0.007, binomial test). In contrast, 3 out of 8 in the CI group (p=0.727), and 5 out of 7 in the HA-group (p = 0.453) looked first at the correct location.

> There were no differences in more general looking pattern during the test event between the groups, such as overall looking at the two areas of interest combined (i.e., both exits of the tunnel), F2,27 =1.59, p=0.222, g2 =0.11 (MTH =1.22s, MCI =1.56s, MHA = 1.70 s); or the mean number of fixations (defined as eye movements less than 0.5pixels/ms) during the test event, F2,27 =1.99, p=0.156, g2 =0.13 (MTH =39, MCI =41, MHA =53). Thus, all groups were equally attentive throughout the test event.
